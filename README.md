Instructions: Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cell with code in it. This will show the best k and then show the accuracy score and the confusion matrix.

Best K: When I ran the data through the KElbowVisualizer, the elbow was at K = 4, showing 4 was the best K

Best Accuracy: When using the vis.elbow_value_ attribute (k=4), I was able to reach accuracy scores of 1.0. This shows that at its best, it had perfect accuracy
